            <h2 class="h-secondary center">Hi, This is Oshin</h2>
            <p>I am not a professional rather a self made artist,and my art is manifestation of my journey in this
                life like road.Every piece I work on has a deeper connection with my inner self which also reflects
                a vision to revolutionize world.In every picture I put an effort to replicate
                love,care,compassion,for every living creature on earth and its meant to motivate and go through a
                journey of adventure and exploration the moment you go through the colors of my art.It will
                challlenge your preconceptions and will make you look at the bold and beautiful side of my art.It's
                not a job or work to make a piece of art,I try to portray those social and emotional situations of
                our life that cannot expressed in words and can be felt from colors and emotions of my paintings.My
                art speaks not only for happy minds but also for those who were silenced long ago,and each work of
                mine will take you to a tour of good and bad times in your life only when you try to dive deeper
                into it.What you will perceive and learn out of my art will make me artist in true sense.If you also
                have interest in sketching and painting just do it,don't think how will it look or how to draw,just
                hold the brush and start making it see the magic your story will make on a blank piece of paper
                which will be later worth million dollars to you and to the consince of billions of people out
                there.Every composition will walk you through various stages of our life since i have been creating
                those amazing things since childhood. </p>
